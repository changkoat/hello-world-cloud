# Book Tracker Web App

This repository contains a simple web application built for the Tech Exercise assignment.

## Overview
The goal of the project is to demonstrate how to insert data and perform searches in a database through a user-friendly web interface. The web application allows users to record book information — including title, author, genre, and a short summary — and provides search functionality to retrieve stored entries by title or author.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Django (Python) — chosen for its straightforward development experience and built-in functionality.
- **Database:** SQLite — lightweight and integrated with Django; suitable for small-scale applications.
- **Deployment:** An Ubuntu-based AWS EC2 instance will host the application, providing cloud hosting and internet accessibility.
- **Version Control:** GitHub will manage source code and track development history.
- **Project Management:** Trello will be used to organize tasks and monitor progress.

## Features
- Add new book entries with title, author, genre, and summary fields.
- Search existing book records by title or author.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started
This repository currently contains a placeholder Flask app; the Django implementation will be added in future commits according to the project plan.
