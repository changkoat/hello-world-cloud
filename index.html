  <h1>Book Tracker Web Application</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my Book Tracker app! This web application allows me to record and search through books using a simple interface backed by a SQLite database.</p>
  <p>This static page is hosted via GitHub Pages and serves as a landing page for the project. The interactive Book Tracker itself runs on a Flask application in the cloud.</p>
  <p>You can browse the source code on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/changkoat/hello-world-cloud">my repository</a>.</p>
  <p>You can try the live application <a href="https://hello-world-cloud.onrender.com/books">here</a>.</p>
